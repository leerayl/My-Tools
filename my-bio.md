# A little about me

I currently work in Software as a Service (SaaS).  I have been working in SaaS full time since 2006 and ERP applications, report writing and BI, and even know how to code a bit.  I am not a "Coder", "L33T H4X0r", "Sr. Dev Lead Eng", or any other such thing but they all are my friends.  I am a [Technologist](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/blog/what-technologist), some call a "Jack of All Trades, Master of None".  I am also on "The Spectrum" where hyperfocus is a comodity.  

In my spare time, I learn, a lot, about a lot.  I am sometimes testing something for work on my own apps I build, I 3D Print, I am trying to learn to draw, use vector images and t-shirt design.  I like to play with just about any tool in the shop, weld, electrical, and all kinds of craft and making.

I am also a lover of Motorcycles and Trikes and currently own 2 Harley-Davidson's (a Springer Custom, and FLRT Freewheeler Trike).  I dig racing sports like F1, and MotoGP, and as I have been able to grow into it, turn some wrenches.  In the garage or a monitor.  I also enjoy video games (RPG and RPG-MMO like Red Dead Online and Fallout76) as well as reading about law and politics, social and culture, and music.
