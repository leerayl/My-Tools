# My-Tools

In both my personal and professional life, I use a lot of tools, guides, languages, frameworks, as well as a ton of other things to do what I do.

I recently started working with a new group of people with great ideas but not as much direct hands on experience so I wanted to document some of the things I think are super important.

## On to the lists

### Things to learn

* Markdown - Markdown is a very easy to learn, easy to use, and portable formatting language. [Here is a link](https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/#learn-markdown) to some really good links to start
* Git - Is a "Source Code Manager" or versioning tool, do not let source code scare you, Git is a very powerful tool
* Command Line Interface (CLI) or Powershell, CLI is the engine that powers most of the development world and to use Git, you need to understand CLI/PS

[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) has courses on [Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) and [CLI](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/bash) that are very good and fast paced.

[FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) also has a ton of great free content and resources to learn

### Tools and Toolbox

I will do my best to keep this list relevant but it does change with the times.

* A modern text editor.  There are tons of good ones but a few things you want to be able to do with it, view hex, binary, encoding and other integration related tools. Text editors like [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), or even a fav of a lot of people [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).  I have used them all and have the first two installed on all my machines.  VS Code below is also a good choice and my daily txt editor.

* [VS Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - Your one and only IDE, trust me on this, unless you write code daily VS Code is the most flexible IDE you can download and use for free today. You can also use it as a text editor

* [GitHub Account](https://github.com/) - You are reading a github page right now, star it with your own account, tons of tech stuff is documented in GitHub or similar tools, GitHub uses markdown so you can see why learning it is important.

* An [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), or [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) account. All offer dev accounts for free or close to free, pick one or all of them but understand the basics of these services as they are the future of tech, still.

### Links, manuals, cheatsheets and other stuff

* Fork or star my stolen [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/leerayl/leerayl/blob/main/markdown-cheat-sheet.md) from [Markdown Guide dot Org](https://www.markdownguide.org)
