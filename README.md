# Thanks for peeking at this repo

It is designed to help me, help you, and do some learning

Read the [my-bio.md](https://github.com/leerayl/My-Tools/blob/main/my-bio.md) to learn more about me

## Why are you doing this

I am doing this to help others with little to no practical development and or technology skills advance their skills but focusing on aspects of **Practical Tools to do my job in technology**

It is not meant to be a catch all or an All-In-On source

This is meant to reduce the burden of implementing what you learn in real world ways

----

Learning some basics of practical hands on technology like building a blog or website, building a cloud storage account, understand why Git is used, why GitHub is so popular, and start building a toolbox that you can continue to build and add into daily.

This is the stuff I didn't really learn in CIS or CIM classes but on the job, doing the work, or just trying to do something for myself.
