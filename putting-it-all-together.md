# Put it together with purpose

One reason I want to build this is to help people who have some skills use those skills before they lose them.  In my day job, I am always trying to find new ways to build things.  I don't always have the time to relearn so I use this method daily to help me stay focused on what matters, build muscle memory and use what I learn.

Tools are what most people think they want but what they need are the basics, below puts together a website that can be used just about anywhere, using the command line, git, github (or other SCV cloud tool), VS Code/Atom.

Before we get to far I want to talk about what and why real quick

## Git is not GitHub and GitHub is not Git

First thing that I got stuck on when I was learning more about modern dev work, I got hung up on GitHub and Git so I wanted to give you the single paragraph that will save you lots of time.

* Git is a tool run on your local machine that allows you to version source code.
* GitHub is a development tool in the cloud that allows for sharing code and code deployment

You work on your computer (not on the web), and you use Git to save your work, test, debug, and then you commit your local git repo to a local branch, in our case we use main for everything to keep it super easy, remember learn what you need and use it.  When you are at a point you want to stop or commit your work, you use the ```git commit``` command to commit the work to your repo.  

None of that used GitHub in anyway, yet.  The power of GitHub is the open nature of opensource software development projects and using opensource tools like the one we will use to build out a website. In our example, we are going to clone a GitHub repo someone else built and add it to our project.

## Markdown is good

As of this writing markdown was used all over and is a very good format that is text based and is very easy to learn.  Using a dot md file is easy and transfers fast.  Need a document, website, note taking, conversions, markdown is easy to work with.  There are several flavors of markdown so stay with what you feel comfortable but know extended versions may have transfer issues.

## VS Code is a one stop shop

Git, GitHub, Markdown are all things you can use in VS Code.  The command line is also available inside of Code.  I consider Code to be my all around tool as it can perform all the functions in one app or tool.  That is the power of IDE or Individual Development Eviornment.  If you are just getting start with adding these tools, start with learning VS Code and how to do it all there.

## Use the Command Line

No matter what, you will need the command line to install a package manager, initialize a git repo, or push code someplace.  Know how to do it and the basics of moving in your OS of choice.

## This is just the tip of the iceberg

Once you start moving through these day to day items, you will want to use more flexible tools.  NPM, Homebrew and other package managers are your next path but that is for another day
