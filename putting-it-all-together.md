# Put it together with purpose

One reason I want to build this is to help people who have some skills use those skills before they lose them.  In my day job, I am always trying to find new ways to build things.  I don't always have the time to relearn so I use this method daily to help me stay focused on what matters, build muscle memory and use what I learn.

Tools are what most people think they want but what they need are the basics, below puts together a website that can be used just about anywhere, using the command line, git, github (or other SCV cloud tool), VS Code/Atom.

Before we get to far I want to talk about what and why real quick

## Git is not GitHub and GitHub is not Git

First thing that I got stuck on when I was learning more about modern dev work, I got hung up on GitHub and Git so I wanted to give you the single paragraph that will save you lots of time.

* Git is a tool run on your local machine that allows you to version source code.
* GitHub is a development tool in the cloud that allows for sharing code and code deployment

You work on your computer (not on the web), and you use Git to save your work, test, debug, and then you commit your local git repo to a local branch, in our case we use main for everything to keep it super easy, remember learn what you need and use it.  When you are at a point you want to stop or commit your work, you use the ```git commit``` command to commit the work to your repo.  

None of that used GitHub in anyway, yet.  The power of GitHub is the open nature of opensource software development projects and using opensource tools like the one we will use to build out a website. In our example, we are going to clone a GitHub repo someone else built and add it to our project.
